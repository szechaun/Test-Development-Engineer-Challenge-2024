# Documentation and rationale
This project uses Cypress as the testing framework for its ease of use, real-time feedback, and built-in assertions. Cypress supports cross-browser testing on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, ensuring compatibility. To set up locally, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher), clone the repository, and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Tests can be executed with `npx cypress open` for the Test Runner or `npx cypress run` for terminal execution. Continuous Integration is handled via GitHub Actions, running tests on every push or pull request. The workflow includes installing dependencies, running Cypress tests, and reporting results. Future enhancements include adding performance and stress testing.

## Overview
This repository contains a calculator web application, and your task is to create automated tests and set up continuous integration. The challenge focuses on your ability to implement test automation and configure GitHub Actions.

## The Calculator
The `index.html` file contains a calculator implementation with these features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ร, รท)
- Parentheses support
- Decimal numbers
- Calculation history
- Error handling

## Challenge Requirements

### 1. Test Implementation
Choose a JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest, Cypress, Playwright) and create test cases for:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Complex calculations with parentheses
- Error scenarios (invalid expressions, division by zero)
- UI interactions and history functionality

### 2. GitHub Actions Setup
Configure GitHub Actions to:
- Install necessary dependencies
- Run the test suite
- Report test results

### 3. Continuous Integration
Implement automated testing that:
- Runs on every push to any branch
- Runs on pull requests to the main branch
- Ensures all tests pass successfully

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository locally
3. Create a new branch for your implementation
4. Choose and set up your testing framework
5. Write your test cases
6. Configure GitHub Actions
7. Create a pull request with your solution

## Submission Requirements

1. Test Files
   - Organized test structure
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. GitHub Actions Configuration
   - Workflow file(s) in `.github/workflows`
   - Proper CI pipeline setup

3. Documentation
   - Update README with:
     - Chosen testing framework and rationale
     - Local test setup instructions
     - Any additional configuration requirements

4. Pull Request
   - Create a PR to the main branch
   - Include detailed description of your implementation
   - Leave the PR open for review

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Test Quality (50%)
   - Test coverage completeness
   - Edge case handling
   - Clear test organization

2. CI/CD Implementation (30%)
   - GitHub Actions configuration
   - Automation setup

3. Code Quality (20%)
